# restaurant_app


This was our last major assignment at The Iron Yard prior to our final project.  The objective was to build a restaurant ordering system that serves many different user types.

The objectives of the assignment were as follows:
- Break a large project into manageable units
- Work with an overwhelmingly broad and "vague" requirements list
- Deliver custom features that you believe will add value to the application.

_This assignment is very large already and is incredibly open ended to the point where you can make this assignment as hard as you can - it's up to you to manage what you believe you can accomplish and not overstretch your goals._ 

_You are to create a user facing web application that provides an end to end solution for a local restaurant's operating needs. The customer has specified some basic functionality but is paying you top dollar to really go above and beyond to wow them on Monday morning._

Here are the customer requests:
- A user should be able to create an account as a cook, a server, or an owner
- An owner should be able to create menu items and set prices for food items
- A server should be able to make an order for a table from a list of available menu options
- A server should be able to add any notes to the order
- A server should be able to submit the order to the cooks in the back
- A cook should be able to see a list of incoming food requests
- A cook should be able to mark an order as completed
- A server should be able to mark a table as paid

_User interface concerns are yours as the application developer to work out._

To complete this assignment, I used Python, Django, Django-Extra-Views, Pillow, Django-Bootstrap-Form, and Django-Math_Filters.
